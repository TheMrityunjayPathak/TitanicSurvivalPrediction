🎯 **The Challenge**

- The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.

- Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

- While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question : “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using Passenger Data.

🛳️ **Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression**

Hello Everyone, 👋 

Here is My Classification Project based on Predicting Survival of Passengers using Logistic Regression.

----------------------------------------

🔸 **Dataset**

I used Titanic Dataset avaliable on Kaggle.

📍 **Link to the Dataset :** [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=test.csv)

----------------------------------------

🌐 **Setting up the Enviroment**

Jupyter Notebook is required for this project and you can install and set it up in the terminal.

> Install the Notebook - `pip install notebook`

> Run the Notebook - `jupyter notebook`

------------------------------------------

📝 **Steps involved in the Project**

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning**

Data Cleaning involves cleaning Different Columns of Dataset and removing anomalies present in them.

- Removing Null Values in the Age Columns and replacing them with Mean Age by using fillna().mean().

- Dropping Cabin Columns as it contains Many Null Values.

- Dropping Text Columns from our Dataset because our Model only works on Numerical Data.

- Creating Dummies Value for Sex Column and Converting it into a DataFrame and Concatenating it with Orignal DataFrame.

2️⃣ **Data Visualization**

Data Visualization involves visualizing Different Columns of Dataset and finding Relationship among them.

- Visualizing Number of People Survived and Not Survived by their Gender using sns.countplot().

- Visualizing Number of People's present in Different Age Group by using sns.histplot().

3️⃣ **Model Building**

I used Logistic Regression for this Problem as here we have to classify the Survival of Passengers.

- Firstly I have created Dependent and Independent Variables for our Traning and Testing.

- I have splitted data into Traning and Testing Set by using Train Test Split.

- Then I Trained the Model with X_train and y_train and checked the Score.

- And Finally I predicted the Result from our Trained Model.
