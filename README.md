# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression]

🛳 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION 🛳

👉 The Challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Now I am pretty much familiar with Regression and Classification Problems, So It is Project Time.

Initially there will be some Basic Projects to get a Hands On with the Code and Machine Learning Understanding, After that there will be Some Real World Based Projects which will be Available on My Kaggle, LinkedIn and GitHub.
